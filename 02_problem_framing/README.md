## Problem Framing Phase

This phase focuses on defining the core business problem to be addressed in this project.

The goal is to:
- Identify a clear and relevant business problem
- Clarify objectives and success criteria
- Break the problem into structured components
- Establish assumptions and constraints

This phase precedes data analysis and solution design to ensure that effort is focused on the right problem.
