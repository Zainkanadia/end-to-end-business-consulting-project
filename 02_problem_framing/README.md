## Problem Framing Phase

This phase focuses on defining the core business problem to be addressed in this project.

The goal is to:
- Identify a clear and relevant business problem
- Clarify objectives and success criteria
- Break the problem into structured components
- Establish assumptions and constraints

This phase precedes data analysis and solution design to ensure that effort is focused on the right problem.

#Problem Statement#

To what extent do fleet delivery delays and geopolitical airspace disruptions threaten Emirates’ unit economics, and what strategic or operational levers can mitigate this impact?

Identified Cost Impacts
1. Fleet Delivery Delays (Boeing 777X)

When new aircraft deliveries are delayed, Emirates must operate older aircraft longer than planned. This results in:

Higher maintenance costs
Aging aircraft require more frequent repairs and part replacements.

Higher fuel consumption
Older aircraft are less fuel-efficient compared to next-generation models.

Increased reliability risk
Older fleets are more prone to technical issues, causing delays and cancellations.

Lower cost efficiency per seat
New aircraft typically reduce cost per seat. Without them, unit costs remain elevated.

Delayed fleet optimization and capacity expansion
Planned retirement of inefficient aircraft and expansion into new markets may be postponed.

2. Geopolitical Airspace Disruptions

Airspace closures or regional instability may force route adjustments. This can lead to:

Longer flight times and higher fuel burn
Rerouted flights increase variable fuel costs.

Higher crew-related costs
Extended flight times may require additional crew hours or augmented crews.

Operational disruption costs
Delays and missed connections increase passenger compensation and re-accommodation expenses.

Reduced aircraft utilization
Longer sector times reduce total daily flight cycles per aircraft.

Higher insurance or risk-related compliance costs
Operating in volatile regions may increase insurance premiums or operational safeguards.

Identified Revenue Impacts
1. Fleet Delivery Delays

Slower capacity growth (ASK constraints)
Inability to add planned seats limits revenue growth.

Delayed new route launches
Market expansion plans may be postponed.

Slower premium product upgrades
Delayed introduction of new-generation cabins may impact premium revenue growth.

Missed incremental demand
Inability to fully capitalize on demand surges during peak travel periods.

2. Geopolitical Disruptions

Reduced transit demand
Longer or less convenient routing may shift passengers to alternative hubs.

Yield pressure
Pricing adjustments may be required to maintain load factors.

Regional demand volatility
Political instability may reduce travel flows in affected markets.

Brand perception risk
Association with regional instability may influence passenger preferences.

Hypothesis

Fleet delivery delays and geopolitical airspace disruptions will increase Emirates’ Cost per Available Seat Kilometer (CASK), primarily through higher fuel consumption, maintenance expenses, and operational inefficiencies. However, due to Emirates’ premium positioning, network strength, and pricing power, overall profitability will face margin pressure but is unlikely to be structurally threatened.
