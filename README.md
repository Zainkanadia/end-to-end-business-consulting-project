# End-to-End Business Consulting Project

## Overview
This repository documents a self-directed, end-to-end project designed to build practical skills in:
- Business fundamentals and strategy
- Consulting-style problem framing
- Data analytics and insight generation
- AI-aligned business decision making

Rather than learning these topics in isolation, this project applies them to a real business problem, following a structured consulting-style approach.

## Project Approach
The project will be developed in phases, similar to a real consulting engagement:
1. Business understanding
2. Problem framing
3. Data analysis
4. Insight development and recommendations
5. AI use-case assessment
6. Reflection and learnings

Each phase will include written analysis, data work, and clear deliverables.

## Current Status
Project initialized.  
Company selection and problem definition will follow.

## Intent
The goal of this project is learning through execution. The work is intentionally iterative and may be incomplete or imperfect at times, reflecting real-world problem solving rather than polished case studies.
