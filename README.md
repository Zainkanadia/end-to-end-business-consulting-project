# End-to-End Business Consulting Project

## Overview
This repository documents a self-directed, end-to-end project designed to build practical skills in:
- Business fundamentals and strategy
- Consulting-style problem framing
- Data analytics and insight generation
- AI-aligned business decision making

Rather than learning these topics in isolation, this project applies them to a real business problem, following a structured consulting-style approach.

## Project Approach
The project will be developed in phases, similar to a real consulting engagement:
1. Business understanding
2. Problem framing
3. Data analysis
4. Insight development and recommendations
5. AI use-case assessment
6. Reflection and learnings

Each phase will include written analysis, data work, and clear deliverables.

## Current Status
Company selected: Emirates Airlines.

An initial exploratory research phase has been completed to understand:
- Emirates’ business model and value proposition
- Revenue streams and cost structure at a high level
- Competitive positioning within the global airline industry
- Strategic context, constraints, and public performance indicators

The project is now transitioning from business understanding into structured problem framing, where specific strategic or operational questions will be defined for deeper analysis.


## Intent
The goal of this project is learning through execution. The work is intentionally iterative and may be incomplete or imperfect at times, reflecting real-world problem solving rather than polished case studies.
